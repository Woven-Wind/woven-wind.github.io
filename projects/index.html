      <h2>Ann Arbor Open Project</h2>
      <p>Ann Arbor Open is a K-8 school of choice in the Ann Arbor school district. 
        We began our partnership at Ann Arbor Open in the fall of 2016. 
        While Woven Wind led outreach days with interactive presentations and hands-on 
        activities in the classroom, we worked to design a wind turbine for the roof of 
        Ann Arbor Open. We strive to involve the 5th and 6th grade students in the design 
        process by visiting the school throughout the year to conduct several educational workshops.

      <h2>Ann Arbor STEAM Project</h2>
      <p>A2 STEAM at Northside is a new K-8 school in the Ann Arbor school district. 
        We collaborated with fifth grade classrooms at A2 STEAM on a wind turbine project.
        The turbine powers two in class applications: an LED display and a pump, which is 
        part of an aquaponics system. Through these activity days, the students are able to 
        understand the engineering concepts used in wind turbines and develop an innovative, 
        engineering way of thinking.

      <h2>Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum Exhibit</h2>
      <p>The Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum is an interactive STEAM museum in Ann Arbor. 
        The museum obtained a grant from the city to proceed with a wind energy project 
        and we were chosen as partners to collaborate on this project. We worked throughout 
        the school year to deign and build a functional wind turbine to be presented at fairs. 
        This turbine will educate the public more on sustainable energy and more specifically, 
        wind energy.

      <h2>El Viento Tejido</h2>
      <p>This international project began with the help of the organization SERES, 
        a non profit focused on empowering people to become leaders of their own sustainable change. 
        Six Woven Wind members travelled to Guatemala to participate in a Collaborative Laboratory 
        (CoLab). Together, the sixteen attendees of the CoLab participated in team building 
        activities and idea-sharing discussions to raise awareness about wind energy.

      <h2>Allen Elementary Project</h2>
      <p>Woven Wind partnered with Allen Elementary. The initial step in 
        designing a turbine is to collect data on the wind; we sent students 
        out to take these measurements for us. The children spent a little time 
        every day recording wind speeds and directions at four potential locations 
        for the wind turbine. We introduced them to basic engineering concepts by 
        using K'nex, generators and LEDs, a small-scale PVC blade prototype and CAD models.

      <h2>ATC Project</h2>
      <p>Woven Wind designed a small wind turbine system with the blades made of 
        textile woven material. We implemented a prototype in Nueva Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan, 
        a village in Guatemala. The team closely collaborated with a women weaving cooperative 
        in the village to co-design the blades. Not only will the turbines provide clean energy, 
        but they will empower women with jobs, as well as display the beautiful textiles and 
        patterns of each community.
